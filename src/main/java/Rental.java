public class Rental {
}
/        RENTAL
//Should have a list as propert
//Methods
//add cars
//remove cars

//        - The user should be able to book a car
// use Enum - Rental status - available/unavailable - update status of car
//        - The user should be able to return a car
// use a loop to search database - same plate number match
// if/conditional change the status

//        4 Things to take into consideration:
//        Create a class called CarRentalDB:
//        - You should have one property that can store a list of cars with corresponding details
//  use a constructor - Brand(Enum),Price,Colour
// use a string for registration - Use as ID
//        - Create a public method for adding a car to the list
//        - Create a public method for deleting a car from the the list if car exists
//        - think about other methods that your application needs
